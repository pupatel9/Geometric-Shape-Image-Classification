# # Geometric Shape Image Classification

## Overview

This project implements a full machine learning pipeline for synthetic image classification. It covers data generation, custom feature extraction, kernel engineering, classical and neural network modeling, and model evaluationâ€”all built from scratch using only NumPy (plus Matplotlib/OpenCV for support tasks). The system is designed to focus on algorithms and engineering rather than reliance on high-level libraries.

## Features

- **Synthetic Dataset Generation:**  
  Creates large, labeled datasets of geometric shape images (circles, squares, triangles) with random placements, sizes, and colors, supporting user-defined complexity and balance.
- **Data Processing and Visualization:**  
  Includes tools for image scaling, overlap-checking, and advanced methods to display and inspect the generated data visually.
- **Patch-Based Feature Extraction:**  
  Extracts grid-based, color-agnostic spatial descriptors for each patch of an image, providing robust representations for classification.
- **Custom Kernel Engineering:**  
  Implements a set kernel comparing image patches for use in kernel SVMs, capturing structural similarities beyond pixel values.
- **Classic and Deep Learning Models:**  
  Contains a NumPy-based Support Vector Machine system and a fully custom CNN implementation with manual forward pass, pooling, and backprop only in the final dense layers.
- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Tools for ROC/AUC evaluation, confidence bands via quantile analysis, computation of baseline/majority accuracy, and standard accuracy utilities.

## Key logics Implemented From Scratch
  - Image dataset synthesis, scaling, shape placement, and label assignment
  - Grid-based spatial color feature computation (centroids, variance, skewness per color per patch)
  - Aggregated patch descriptors for color-agnostic classification
  - Grid-based set kernel for pairwise similarity
  - SVM kernel matrix computation without scikit-learn
  - Simple CNN with manual convolution, ReLU, pooling, flattening, and two-layer perceptron (fully NumPy-based)
  - Custom ROC/AUC/quantile evaluation utilities
